  "title": "Why do I need Self Defense Instructor Insurance?",
  "description": "As a self defense instructor, you help people protect themselves from assault, robbery, and anything that comes their way. There’s nothing better than knowing you give your students the skills and confidence to walk down the street without fear. You deserve that same confidence while working as a self defense instructor. Whether you’re demoing an attack or supervising partner work, though, there’s always the risk something can go wrong during training. If one of your clients injures the other while practicing a bear-hug escape, you could be liable for a medical bill and bodily injury claim. If you’re not protected with Self Defense Instructor Insurance, you may be responsible for those costs, as well as any attorney’s fees. Situations like these are exactly why you need Self Defense Instructor Insurance."
